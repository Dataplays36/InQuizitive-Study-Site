		<h1>About</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			This project’s goal is to create a free website-based platform that users can easily access to study subjects from their class in a manner that is tailored to their preferences<br>
			Users will be able to work with sets of problems that they need to study<br> 
			The website will also suggest other problem sets that the user may find useful in their studies of a certain subject.<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Our Motivation</h2>
		<p>
			There are many study tools available on the world wide web. However, many of them are blocked by what’s commonly referred to as a “pay wall,”<br>
			which is simply a block put in the way of users until the host of the website/resource is paid for the user’s access and usage.<br>
			Our goal is to create a free and easily accessible platform that allows users to study any subject (mathematics, sciences, literature) they need, without adding another bill to pay.<br>
